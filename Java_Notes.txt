> Software is collection various programs.
  Types of Software :

  > System Software : 
     - This software used to develope functions of hardware devices.
     - Prog. Lang -> Assembly Lang., C Lang.

  > Application Software : 
    - This s/w is used to develop organization oriented application or to solve specific use cases.
    
    -> Standalone Application        
    -> Distributed Application
  
  Internet/Web Software
    -> This s/w is used to develope organization oriented problems in a distributed manner.

History Of Java :
    - Team in Sun Microsystem started working on Java language dev. to solve the consumer devices problems.
    - Java development has started in 1990
    - James Gosling(Founder/Father Of Java) lead this Java Devlopment team.
    - Initially Java named as OAK Language.
    - In 1995 they have renames to Java.
    - When Java initially released they have released in three flavours.
           - J2SE(Java 2 Standard Edition)
             - It is used mainly for devloping Standalone application.

           - J2EE(Java 2 Enterprise Edition)
             - It is mainly used for devloping Web Based application.

           - J2ME(Java 2 Micro/Mobile Edition)
             - It is mainly used for devloping Mobile OS and it's related application

          1. Simple
          2. Platform Independent
          3. Architectural Neutral
          4. Portable
          5. Multithreaded

          7. Distributed
          8. High Performance
          9. Robust
          10. Dynamic
          11. Interpreted
          12. Secured
          13. OOPL 

  1. Simple :-
        Java is one of the simple programming language because of the following points.
              - Java programming doesn't support a complex concept called pointers.
              - Java introduced concept of byte code.

              Q. Define bytecode & JVM?
                ByteCode : ByteCode is the set of optimised instructions generated during compilation phase & it is more powerful than ordinary pointer code.
                JVM : JVM is set of programs developed by Sun Microsytems & supplied as a part of jdk for reading line by line of byte code & convert into native understanding form of OS.

                * Java language is one of the compiled & interpreted programming language.
              
              - Memory Allocation:
                   Java programming execution environment contain inbuilt garbage collection program for automatic memory management for strenghning the performance of Java/J2EE applications.
              
              Q. Define Garbage Collector.
              => Garbage Collector is one of the background system java program which is running internally along with our regular Java program for collecting unused/unreferenced memory space for improving the performance of our applications.

                 
  2. Platform Independent :-
     A platform independent technology/language related applications rung on every OS, without considering their vendors.
     In order to say particular language is platform independent if and only if it has to satisfy the following properties.
       - The language must have data types & they must take same amount of memory space.
       - The language must contain some special internal programs which will convert from one format of one OS to another format of another OS.
     The languages like c, c++ are treated as platform dependent whereas Java language is treated as platform independent language.
      
  3. Architectural Neutral :
     An application is said to be architectural neutral if and only if the application runs on every processor without considering their architectures and vendors(providors).
     A language is said to be architectural neutral, it has to satisfy the following property.
     - The s/w must have the special internal programs which will convert the factors of one processor to factors of another processor.
     - The language like Java is one of the architectural neutral language because it satisfies the above property.
     - The basic aim of Sun microsystem is that Java applications must run without considering about software benchmarks and hardware benchmarks.

  4. Portable : 
     A portable is one which will run on every operating system and one every processor without considering their vendors and architectures.
     Tha applications of c, c++, pascal etc. are treated as non portable applications.
     All the Java applications are treated as portable applications.

     According to Sun Microsystem :

          Portability = Platform Independent + Architectural Neutral
